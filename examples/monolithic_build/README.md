# Monolithic Build (C Backend)

This directory contains a minimal example for building mlkem-native as a single compilation unit
using the auto-generated `mlkem_native.c` file.

## Use Case

Use this approach when:
- You want the simplest possible build integration (one `.c` file)
- You're using only C (no native backends)

## Components

1. Auto-generated [mlkem_native.c](mlkem_native/mlkem_native.c) (includes all C sources)
2. A secure random number generator implementing [`randombytes.h`](../../mlkem/src/randombytes.h)
3. Your application source code

## Configuration

The configuration file [mlkem_native_config.h](mlkem_native/mlkem_native_config.h) sets:
- `MLK_CONFIG_PARAMETER_SET`: Security level (default 768)
- `MLK_CONFIG_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`: Symbol prefix (set to `mlkem`)
- `MLK_CONFIG_INTERNAL_API_QUALIFIER=static`: Makes internal functions static for single-CU builds

The auto-generated `mlkem_native.c`:
- Includes all mlkem-native C source files
- Clears all internal `#define`s at the end, allowing multiple inclusion

## Notes

- The monolithic `.c` file is auto-generated by `scripts/autogen`
- Internal functions become `static`, enabling better compiler optimization

## Usage

```bash
make build   # Build the example
make run     # Run the example
```

## Warning

The `randombytes()` implementation in `test_only_rng/` is for TESTING ONLY.
You MUST provide a cryptographically secure RNG for production use.
