mlkem-native is a secure, fast, and portable C90 implementation of ML-KEM[^FIPS203].
It is a fork of the ML-KEM reference implementation[^REF].

All C code in [mlkem/src/*](mlkem) and [mlkem/src/fips202/*](mlkem/src/fips202) is proved memory-safe (no memory overflow) and type-safe (no integer overflow)
using [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc). All AArch64 assembly is proved functionally correct at the object code level using
[HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light).

mlkem-native is supported by the [Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance](https://pqca.org/) as part of the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/).

## Supported platforms

mlkem-native is highly portable C90 code that is continuously tested across various 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit
C-compilers (including gcc, clang, mingw, msvc, zig, gcc-avr) and target architectures (including x86_64, AArch64,
RISC-V32, RISC-V64, PPC64LE, AVR). It has minimal dependencies on the standard library, all of which can be customized
(see [STDLIB.md](STDLIB.md)). If mlkem-native does not work out of the box for you, please file an issue!

mlkem-native also includes native code for the following architectures; see [benchmarks](https://pq-code-package.github.io/mlkem-native/dev/bench/):
* Armv8-A + Neon
* x86_64/AMD64 + AVX2
* RISC-V64 + RVV

## Quickstart for Ubuntu

```bash
# Install base packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make gcc python3 git

# Clone mlkem-native
git clone https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native.git
cd mlkem-native

# Build and run tests
make build
make test

# The same using `tests`, a convenience wrapper around `make`
./scripts/tests all
# Show all options
./scripts/tests --help
```

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for more information.

## Applications

mlkem-native is used in
 - [libOQS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) of the Open Quantum Safe project since [0.13.0](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.13.0) (as the default ML-KEM implementation)
 - AWS' Cryptography library [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/) since [v1.50.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/releases/tag/v1.50.0)
 - The [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) TLS library written in Rust since [0.23.28](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/releases/tag/v%2F0.23.28) (through AWS-LC as the default cryptography provider)

## Formal Verification

All C code in [mlkem/src/*](mlkem) and [mlkem/src/fips202/*](mlkem/src/fips202) is proved memory-safe (no memory overflow) and type-safe (no integer overflow).
This uses the [C Bounded Model Checker (CBMC)](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) and builds on function contracts and loop invariant annotations
in the source code. See [proofs/cbmc](proofs/cbmc) for details.

All AArch64 assembly is proved functionally correct at the object-code level. This uses the [HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light)
interactive theorem prover and the [s2n-bignum](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n-bignum/) verification infrastructure (which includes a model of the
relevant parts of the Arm architecture). See [proofs/hol_light/arm](proofs/hol_light/arm) for details.

## Security

All assembly in mlkem-native is constant-time in the sense that it is free of secret-dependent control flow, memory access,
and instructions that are commonly variable-time, thwarting most timing side channels. C code is hardened against compiler-introduced
timing side channels (such as KyberSlash[^KyberSlash] or clangover[^clangover])
through suitable barriers and constant-time patterns.

Absence of secret-dependent branches, memory-access patterns and variable-latency instructions is also tested using `valgrind`
with various combinations of compilers and compilation options.

## Design

mlkem-native is split into a _frontend_ and two _backends_ for arithmetic and FIPS202 / SHA3. The frontend is
fixed, written in C, and covers all routines that are not critical to performance. The backends are flexible, take care of
performance-sensitive routines, and can be implemented in C or native code (assembly/intrinsics); see
[mlkem/src/native/api.h](mlkem/src/native/api.h) for the arithmetic backend and
[mlkem/src/fips202/native/api.h](mlkem/src/fips202/native/api.h) for the FIPS-202 backend.

mlkem-native currently offers the following backends:

* Default portable C backend
* 64-bit Arm backend (using Neon)
* 64-bit Intel/AMD backend (using AVX2)
* 64-bit RISC-V backend (using RVV)

If you'd like contribute new backends, please reach out or just open a PR.

Our AArch64 assembly is developed using the [SLOTHY](https://github.com/slothy-optimizer/slothy) superoptimizer, following the approach described in the SLOTHY paper[^SLOTHY_Paper]:
We write 'clean' assembly by hand and automate micro-optimizations (e.g. see the [clean](dev/aarch64_clean/src/ntt.S) vs [optimized](dev/aarch64_opt/src/ntt.S) AArch64 NTT).
See [dev/README.md](dev/README.md) for more details.

## Usage

If you want to use mlkem-native, import [mlkem](mlkem) into your project's source tree and build using your favourite build system. See [mlkem](mlkem) for more information, and
[examples/basic](examples/basic) for a simple example. The build system provided in this repository is for development purposes only.

### Can I bring my own FIPS-202?

mlkem-native relies on and comes with an implementation of FIPS-202[^FIPS202]. If your library has its own FIPS-202 implementation, you
can use it instead of the one shipped with mlkem-native. See [FIPS202.md](FIPS202.md), and [examples/bring_your_own_fips202](examples/bring_your_own_fips202)
for an example using tiny_sha3[^tiny_sha3].

### Do I need to use the assembly backends?

No. If you want a C-only build, just omit the directories [mlkem/src/native](mlkem/src/native) and/or [mlkem/src/fips202/native](mlkem/src/fips202/native) from your import
and unset `MLK_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_BACKEND_ARITH` and/or `MLK_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_BACKEND_FIPS202` in your [config.h](mlkem/src/config.h).

### Do I need to setup CBMC to use mlkem-native?

No. While we recommend that you consider using it, mlkem-native will build + run fine without CBMC -- just make sure to
include [cbmc.h](mlkem/src/cbmc.h) and have `CBMC` undefined. In particular, you do _not_ need to remove all function
contracts and loop invariants from the code; they will be ignored unless `CBMC` is set.

### Does mlkem-native support all security levels of ML-KEM?

Yes. The security level is a compile-time parameter configured by setting `MLK_CONFIG_PARAMETER_SET=512/768/1024` in [config.h](mlkem/src/config.h).
If your library/application requires multiple security levels, you can build + link three instances of mlkem-native
while sharing common code; this is called a 'multi-level build' and is demonstrated in [examples/multilevel_build](examples/multilevel_build). See also [mlkem](mlkem).

### Can I bring my own backend?

Yes, you can add further backends for ML-KEM native arithmetic and/or for FIPS-202. Follow the existing backends
as templates or see [examples/custom_backend](examples/custom_backend) for a minimal example how to register a custom backend.

## Have a Question?
